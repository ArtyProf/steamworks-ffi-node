# Steamworks FFI Documentation

Complete API documentation for all Steamworks FFI functionality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Manager-Based API

Steamworks FFI uses a **manager-based architecture** for better organization:

```typescript
import SteamworksSDK from 'steamworks-ffi-node';

const steam = new SteamworksSDK();
steam.init({ appId: 480 });

// Access features through specialized managers
steam.achievements.*  // Achievement operations
steam.stats.*         // Statistics operations  
steam.leaderboards.*  // Leaderboard operations
```

This design:
- âœ… **Groups related functions** - Easy to discover all achievement/stats/leaderboard methods
- âœ… **Clear namespacing** - No naming conflicts
- âœ… **Better IDE support** - Autocomplete shows relevant methods
- âœ… **Logical organization** - Matches Steamworks SDK structure
