# Steamworks FFI Documentation

Complete API documentation for all Steamworks FFI functionality.

## üéØ Manager-Based API

Steamworks FFI uses a **manager-based architecture** for better organization:

```typescript
import SteamworksSDK from 'steamworks-ffi-node';

const steam = new SteamworksSDK();
steam.init({ appId: 480 });

// Access features through specialized managers
steam.achievements.*   // Achievement operations
steam.stats.*          // Statistics operations  
steam.leaderboards.*   // Leaderboard operations
steam.friends.*        // Friends and social operations
steam.richPresence.*   // Rich Presence operations
steam.overlay.*        // Overlay control operations
steam.cloud.*          // Cloud storage operations
steam.workshop.*       // Workshop/UGC operations
```

This design:
- ‚úÖ **Groups related functions** - Easy to discover all achievement/stats/leaderboard methods
- ‚úÖ **Clear namespacing** - No naming conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Better IDE support** - Autocomplete shows relevant methods
- ‚úÖ **Logical organization** - Matches Steamworks SDK structure
