## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install the package
npm install steamworks-ffi-node
```

### Setup

1. **Download Steamworks SDK** (required separately due to licensing):

   - Visit [Steamworks Partner site](https://partner.steamgames.com/)
   - Download the latest Steamworks SDK
   - Extract and copy `redistributable_bin` folder to your project
   - See [STEAMWORKS_SDK_SETUP.md](https://github.com/ArtyProf/steamworks-ffi-node/blob/main/docs/STEAMWORKS_SDK_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
   - Default location: `steamworks_sdk/` in project root
   - Can now use custom locations! See `setSdkPath()` method below

2. **Set your Steam App ID** - No file creation needed!

   The library automatically sets the `SteamAppId` environment variable when you call `init()`.
   
   **For Development (Default SDK Location):**
   ```typescript
   const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();
   
   // SDK at: your-project/steamworks_sdk/
   if (steam.restartAppIfNecessary(480)) {
     process.exit(0);
   }
   
   steam.init({ appId: 480 });
   ```
   
   **For Custom SDK Location:**
   ```typescript
   const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();
   
   // IMPORTANT: Set SDK path BEFORE restartAppIfNecessary() or init()
   steam.setSdkPath('vendor/steamworks_sdk');  // SDK in vendor folder
   
   if (steam.restartAppIfNecessary(480)) {
     process.exit(0);
   }
   
   steam.init({ appId: 480 });
   ```
   
   **Custom SDK Path Examples:**
   ```typescript
   // SDK in vendor folder: your-project/vendor/steamworks_sdk/
   steam.setSdkPath('vendor/steamworks_sdk');
   
   // SDK in nested structure: your-project/source/main/sdk/steamworks/
   steam.setSdkPath('source/main/sdk/steamworks');
   
   // SDK in monorepo: monorepo/packages/game/steamworks_sdk/
   steam.setSdkPath('packages/game/steamworks_sdk');
   ```
   
   **Debug Mode (Optional):**
   ```typescript
   const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();
   
   // Enable debug logs to see initialization details
   steam.setDebug(true);
   
   // Set custom SDK path if needed (debug logs will show path resolution)
   steam.setSdkPath('vendor/steamworks_sdk');
   
   // Check restart requirement (debug logs will show library loading)
   if (steam.restartAppIfNecessary(480)) {
     process.exit(0);
   }
   
   // Initialize (debug logs will show initialization steps)
   steam.init({ appId: 480 });
   
   // Disable debug logs after initialization
   steam.setDebug(false);
   ```
   
   > **Note:** Debug mode is useful for troubleshooting SDK path issues and initialization problems.
   > Errors and warnings always display regardless of debug mode setting.

   **Optional: Create `steam_appid.txt` manually** (if needed for other tools):
   ```bash
   echo "480" > steam_appid.txt  # Use 480 for testing, or your Steam App ID
   ```
   
   **For Production:**
   ```typescript
   // Check if launched through Steam, restart if necessary
   if (steam.restartAppIfNecessary(480)) {
     process.exit(0); // Steam will relaunch your app
   }
   
   steam.init({ appId: 480 });
   ```

3. **Make sure Steam is running** and you're logged in

### Basic Usage

```typescript

} from "steamworks-ffi-node";

// Helper to auto-start callback polling
function startCallbackPolling(steam: SteamworksSDK, interval: number = 1000) {
  return setInterval(() => {
    steam.runCallbacks();
  }, interval);
}

// Initialize Steam connection
const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();
const initialized = steam.init({ appId: 480 }); // Your Steam App ID

if (initialized) {
  // Start callback polling automatically (required for async operations)
  const callbackInterval = startCallbackPolling(steam, 1000);

  // Get current Steam language for localization
  const language = steam.getCurrentGameLanguage();
  console.log("Steam language:", language); // e.g., 'english', 'french', 'german'

  // Get achievements from Steam servers
  const achievements = await steam.achievements.getAllAchievements();

  // Track user statistics
  const kills = (await steam.stats.getStatInt("total_kills")) || 0;
  await steam.stats.setStatInt("total_kills", kills + 1);

  // Get global statistics
  await steam.stats.requestGlobalStats(7);

  console.log("Total kills worldwide:", globalKills);

  // Work with leaderboards
  const leaderboard = await steam.leaderboards.findOrCreateLeaderboard(

## Steamworks Integration

This library connects directly to the Steam client and Steamworks SDK:

```javascript
// Steamworks API
const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();
steam.init({ appId: 480 }); // Connects to actual Steam

// Live achievements from Steam servers
const achievements = await steam.achievements.getAllAchievements();
console.log(achievements); // Achievement data from your Steam app

// Permanent achievement unlock in Steam
await steam.achievements.unlockAchievement("YOUR_ACHIEVEMENT");
// ^ This shows up in Steam overlay and is saved permanently
```

**What happens when you unlock an achievement:**

- ✅ Steam overlay notification appears
- ✅ Achievement saved to Steam servers permanently
- ✅ Syncs across all devices
- ✅ Appears in Steam profile
- ✅ Counts toward Steam statistics

## Electron Integration

For Electron applications, use it in your main process:

```typescript
// main.ts
import { app } from "electron";
import SteamworksSDK from "steamworks-ffi-node";

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();

  if (steam.init({ appId: YOUR_STEAM_APP_ID })) {
    console.log("Steam initialized in Electron!");

    // Handle achievement unlocks from renderer process
    // via IPC if needed
  }
});

app.on("before-quit", () => {
  const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();
  steam.shutdown();
});
```

### 📦 Electron Packaging

For Electron applications, the library will automatically detect the Steamworks SDK files in your project directory. No special packaging configuration is needed - just ensure your `steamworks_sdk/redistributable_bin` folder is present in your project.

The library searches for the SDK in standard locations within your Electron app bundle.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: 18+
- **Steam Client**: Must be running and logged in
- **Steam App ID**: Get yours at [Steamworks Partner](https://partner.steamgames.com/) and pass to `steam.init({ appId: YOUR_APP_ID })`
- No file creation required - library uses environment variables automatically
- Optional: You can manually create `steam_appid.txt` if needed for other Steam tools

### Platform Support

- ✅ **Windows**: steam_api64.dll / steam_api.dll
- ✅ **macOS**: libsteam_api.dylib
- ✅ **Linux x64**: libsteam_api.so
- ✅ **Linux x86**: libsteam_api.so
- ✅ **Linux ARM64**: libsteam_api.so (SDK 1.63+)
- ✅ **Android ARM64**: libsteam_api.so (SDK 1.63+)

**Steamworks SDK Version**: v1.63 (Latest)

_Note: You must download and install the SDK redistributables separately as described in the Setup section above._

## Troubleshooting

### "SteamAPI_Init failed"

- ❌ Steam client not running → **Solution**: Start Steam and log in
- ❌ No App ID specified → **Solution**: Pass App ID to `steam.init({ appId: 480 })` (library sets environment variable automatically)
- ❌ Invalid App ID → **Solution**: Use 480 for testing, or your registered App ID from Steamworks Partner
- ℹ️ **Note**: The library automatically handles App ID via environment variables - no file creation needed!

### "Cannot find module 'steamworks-ffi-node'"

- ❌ Package not installed → **Solution**: Run `npm install steamworks-ffi-node`

### Achievement operations not working

- ❌ Not initialized → **Solution**: Call `steam.init({ appId })` first
- ❌ No achievements configured → **Solution**: Configure achievements in Steamworks Partner site
- ❌ Using Spacewar → **Note**: Spacewar may not have achievements, use your own App ID

### Electron-specific issues

- ❌ Initialized in renderer → **Solution**: Only initialize in main process
- ❌ Not cleaning up → **Solution**: Call `shutdown()` in `before-quit` event
- ❌ "Steamworks SDK library not found" in packaged app → **Solution**: Include SDK redistributables in your build (see Electron Packaging section above)
- ❌ Native module errors in packaged app → **Solution**: Ensure Steamworks SDK files are properly included in your app bundle
